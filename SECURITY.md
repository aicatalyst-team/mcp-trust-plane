# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**  
Security flaws in MCP filters or providers handling data-guard logic can have 
serious downstream impact on applications and integrations that depend on them.

### GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)

Use GitHub's built-in private reporting:
1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill in the details and submit

This is the preferred method as it keeps the disclosure private and allows 
collaborative resolution directly on GitHub.

### Email

If you are unable to use GitHub's private reporting, email us at:  
security@abluva.com

Please use the subject line: `[SECURITY] <brief description>`
